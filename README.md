My Nix shell configuration

This repo contains my Nix shell configuration which I share between machines
at home.

## Installation

I don't know enough yet to know the best-practices in this area, but a simple
way to make use of it is to clone this and then link the `shell.nix` file.

```bash
> ln -sf ~/nix-config/shell.nix ~/shell.nix
```
